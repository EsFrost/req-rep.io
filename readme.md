# Req-Rep.io

## Req-Rep.io is a simple HTTP client for Windows, Linux and macOS.

It was created using the Electron framework which I have worked with before and I find using it faster, easier and more enjoyable to develop with.

## Why Req-Rep.io ?

This is an open source project, feel free to fork, download, modify etc. You have absolute control over what is happening. It can be used as a base for a much more complex and complete project.

### Why not Postman ?

Req-Rep.io does not use any sort of accounts, does not collect any sort of data and is completely free, while maintaining similar functionality to Postman. If there are any features missing you can either add them yourself or suggest the change and I will try to implement it.

### Why not curl ?

In case you want an intuitive app with GUI since curl is a command line tool and you might not want to remember all the flags and options. On the other hand, as mentioned before, if any command or flag is missing, you can always add it yourself or request for it to be added.

*I hope you find this project useful, intuitive, easy to use, easy to modify and instructive.*

If the final project's size is too large, please download the source code and build it yourself.

Any and all suggestions are welcome.
